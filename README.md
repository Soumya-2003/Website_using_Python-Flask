# Website_using_Python-Flask
A sample Website made using Python and Flask framework
In this repository, I've created a website using python as fast as possible. I've used the flask module which
is web framework for Python.
This is relatively simple and quick mini project to learn the Flask framework, HTMl and JavaScript file to import
in the Python file that builds a effective and simple Website.
